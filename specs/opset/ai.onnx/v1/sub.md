Performs element-wise binary subtraction (with limited broadcast support).

If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the
shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second
tensor can either be of element size 1 (including a scalar tensor and any
tensor with rank equal to or smaller than the first tensor), or having its
shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of the
mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set,
suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.

For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):

  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar tensor
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (1, 1), i.e. B is an 1-element tensor
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (5,)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (4, 5)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3, 4), with axis=1
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (2), with axis=0

Attribute `broadcast=1` needs to be passed to enable broadcasting.
