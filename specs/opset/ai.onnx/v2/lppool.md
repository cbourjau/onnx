  update:
  - name: X
    type: T
    doc: Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions for image case are
      (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels, and
      H and W are the height and the width of the data. For non image case, the dimensions
      are in the form of (N x C x D1 x D2 ... Dn), where N is the batch size.
attributes:
  update:
  - name: kernel_shape
    type: ints
    doc: The size of the kernel along each axis.
    required: true
  - name: auto_pad
    type: string
    doc: auto_pad must be either NOTSET, SAME_UPPER, SAME_LOWER or VALID. Where default
      value is NOTSET, which means explicit padding is used. SAME_UPPER or SAME_LOWER
      mean pad the input so that the output spatial size match the input.In case of
      odd number add the extra padding at the end for SAME_UPPER and at the beginning
      for SAME_LOWER. VALID mean no padding.
    required: false
    default: NOTSET
  - name: p
    type: int
    doc: p value of the Lp norm used to pool over the input data.
    required: false
    default: 2
  - name: pads
    type: ints
    doc: Padding for the beginning and ending along each spatial axis, it can take
      any value greater than or equal to 0. The value represent the number of pixels
      added to the beginning and end part of the corresponding axis. `pads` format
      should be as follow [x1_begin, x2_begin...x1_end, x2_end,...], where xi_begin
      the number of pixels added at the beginning of axis `i` and xi_end, the number
      of pixels added at the end of axis `i`. This attribute cannot be used simultaneously
      with auto_pad attribute. If not present, the padding defaults to 0 along start
      and end of each spatial axis.
    required: false
  - name: strides
    type: ints
    doc: Stride along each spatial axis.
    required: false

LpPool consumes an input tensor X and applies Lp pooling across
 the tensor according to kernel sizes, stride sizes, and pad lengths.
 Lp pooling consisting of computing the Lp norm on all values of a subset
 of the input tensor according to the kernel size and downsampling the
 data into the output tensor Y for further processing.
