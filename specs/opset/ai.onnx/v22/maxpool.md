MaxPool consumes an input tensor X and applies max pooling across
 the tensor according to kernel sizes, stride sizes, and pad lengths.
 max pooling consisting of computing the max on all values of a
 subset of the input tensor according to the kernel size and downsampling the
 data into the output tensor Y for further processing. The output spatial shape is calculated differently
 depending on whether explicit padding is used, where pads is employed, or auto padding is used, where auto_pad is utilized.
 With explicit padding (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.MaxPool2d.html?highlight=maxpool#torch.nn.MaxPool2d):
 ```
 output_spatial_shape[i] = floor((input_spatial_shape[i] + pad_shape[i] - dilation[i] * (kernel_shape[i] - 1) - 1) / strides_spatial_shape[i] + 1)
 ```
 or
 ```
 output_spatial_shape[i] = ceil((input_spatial_shape[i] + pad_shape[i] - dilation[i] * (kernel_shape[i] - 1) - 1) / strides_spatial_shape[i] + 1)
 ```
 if ceil_mode is enabled. `pad_shape[i]` is the sum of pads along axis `i`. Sliding windows that would start in the right padded region are ignored.

 `auto_pad` is a DEPRECATED attribute. If you are using them currently, the output spatial shape will be following when ceil_mode is enabled:
 ```
 VALID: output_spatial_shape[i] = ceil((input_spatial_shape[i] - ((kernel_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * dilations[i] + 1) + 1) / strides_spatial_shape[i])
 SAME_UPPER or SAME_LOWER: output_spatial_shape[i] = ceil(input_spatial_shape[i] / strides_spatial_shape[i])
 ```
 or when ceil_mode is disabled (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/AveragePooling2D):
 ```
 VALID: output_spatial_shape[i] = floor((input_spatial_shape[i] - ((kernel_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * dilations[i] + 1)) / strides_spatial_shape[i]) + 1
 SAME_UPPER or SAME_LOWER: output_spatial_shape[i] = floor((input_spatial_shape[i] - 1) / strides_spatial_shape[i]) + 1
 ```
 And pad shape will be following if `SAME_UPPER` or `SAME_LOWER`:
 ```
 pad_shape[i] = (output_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * strides_spatial_shape[i] + ((kernel_spatial_shape[i] - 1) * dilations[i] + 1) - input_spatial_shape[i]
 ```
 The output of each pooling window is maximum number of elements exclude pad.
