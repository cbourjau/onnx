      C is a scalar 0. The shape of C should be unidirectional broadcastable to (M,

General Matrix multiplication:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms#Level_3

A' = transpose(A) if transA else A

B' = transpose(B) if transB else B

Compute Y = alpha * A' * B' + beta * C, where input tensor A has shape (M, K) or (K, M),
input tensor B has shape (K, N) or (N, K), input tensor C is broadcastable to shape (M, N),
and output tensor Y has shape (M, N). A will be transposed before doing the
computation if attribute transA is non-zero, same for B and transB.
This operator supports **unidirectional broadcasting** (tensor C should be unidirectional broadcastable to tensor A * B); for more details please check [the doc](Broadcasting.md).
This operator has **optional** inputs/outputs. See [the doc](IR.md) for more details about the representation of optional arguments. An empty string may be used in the place of an actual argument's name to indicate a missing argument. Trailing optional arguments (those not followed by an argument that is present) may also be simply omitted.
