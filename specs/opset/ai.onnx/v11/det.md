Det calculates determinant of a square matrix or batches of square matrices.
Det takes one input tensor of shape `[*, M, M]`, where `*` is zero or more batch dimensions,
and the inner-most 2 dimensions form square matrices.
The output is a tensor of shape `[*]`, containing the determinants of all input submatrices.
e.g., When the input is 2-D, the output is a scalar(shape is empty: `[]`).
